* A lot of this fiddling and encapsulating looks like it could easily be abused into ravioli code
* Could just be a quirk of language, but it's profoundly uncomfortable that CONCRETE classes change more than ABSTRACT classes
* The depth of "how to recognize the likelihood of a class changing" is what's been missing from other books
* Abstractions by accident; never thought about that, but I've been in a static language my whole programming career
* There's less helpful text in here about abstractions in static languages
* Still didn't really dig into the hows and whys of abstractions being more stable. I know they are, but it's really taken for granted that you understand that here
* Figure 3.2 resembles some charts I've seen in Martin books about class relationships to their collaborators/depnedents
  * I think it's in the *Agile Handbook*
* This was definitely the most useful chapter so far, with a lot of "why" around what many other books have given as "how"
